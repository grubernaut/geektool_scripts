Geektool Scripts
======================================

Brief Collection of Geektool scripts that I wrote. 

Back when I had a huge second monitor on my iMac, I used GeekTool to display critical
data, such as Cacti Generated pnp4nagios graphs and Twitter feeds. 

Here are the scripts that I wrote custom to my needs with Geektool. 

* Bitcoin.rb - Uses the BitCoinCharts API to Return the Highest, Average, Lowest, Latest,
  and NetWorth Values of these Bitcoin Markets: BitStamp, BitFINEX, btce, localbtc.
* Ping.sh - Shows how long (in ms) from host [ ARGV$1 ] you are, or if the host is down to
  you. 
* Ram.sh - Shows Ram Statistics, including Inactive RAM and Free RAM. Also shows computer
  uptime. 


These are fairly simple, but I thought they were neat. Also didn't want to leave them on
my local computer so up they go. 

PR are always welcome. Also, feel free to add to these as you like.
